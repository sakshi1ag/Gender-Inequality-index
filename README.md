# Gender-Inequality-index
I have completed an EDA project using the data set named ‘Gender Inequality Index’ taken from Kaggle and using the python and its libraries, I cleaned the data using various techniques and imputed missing value data , also find out useful insights which summarises the datasets. I have used numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries of python.
